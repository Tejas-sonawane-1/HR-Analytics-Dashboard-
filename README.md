# 📊 HR Analytics Dashboard – Power BI

This project is an end-to-end **HR Analytics Dashboard** built using Power BI to analyze employee attrition, salary behavior, job satisfaction, and workforce patterns. The goal is to understand **why employees leave** and identify hidden insights across age groups, experience levels, job roles, education, distance, salary ranges, and departments.

The dashboard converts raw HR data into clear, actionable insights that improve decision-making for HR teams.
